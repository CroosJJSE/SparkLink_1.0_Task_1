# SparkLink_1.0_Task_1
Implement the functionality of a 4-bit full adder using Verilog.

Design a Verilog module that can perform the addition of two 4-bit binary numbers with additional carry-in bit, considering 4-bit inputs (Num_l & Num_2) and a carry-in (C_in). The output should include the A-bit sum (Out) and carry-out (C_out). Ensure that the design is efficient and follows the full adder operation.

we have to implement the high effiecient design, so we did high level abstraction.
